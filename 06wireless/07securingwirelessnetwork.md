- Basic design and implementation

- Wireless Security
-----------------------
    * Authentication
        password
        certificates

    * Encyrption
        encrypting data sent over wireless network

    * Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)


- Encryption and Authentication combinations
-------------------------------------------------------

    Originally -> Pre-shared key WEP

    Evolution 1: TKIP and Pre-shared Key WPA1
    Evolution 2: WPA and 802.1x Authentication
    Evolution 3: WPA (802.11x) AES  and 802.1x authentication


- SSID
---------
    Service Set Identifier
        - Uniquely identifies and separates wireless networks

        - When a client is enabled;
            * Client issues a probe
            * Access point responds wit a beacon
            * Client associates with chosen SSID
            * Access point adds client MAC to destination table.

- Correct design of a WLAN
-----------------------------

    RF service areas should have  10 - 15% overlap

    Repeaters should have 50% Overlap.

    Bordering Access points should use different channels.


- Understanding terms
-------------------------
    (BSS) Basic Service Set
        - A single Access Point and all of the service area that it's able to reach.

    Extended Servie Set (ESS)
        - Two or more BSS joined to a common switchj

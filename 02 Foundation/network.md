- Examples of applications that use networks
- Network design

* What is a network?
-------------------------
    - Collection of devices that can communicate together
    - The fabric ("roads in Rome") that ties applications together


- Applications that use the network
-------------------------------------------
    - Web browser and FTP (mozilla firefox,microsoft edge) 
    - Database applications
    - Instant messenger
    - Email (esp organizations)
    - Online games

- Considerations for network applications
    - Speed
            bit
             |
            byte
             |
            kilobyte
             |
            megabyte
             |
            gigabyte
             |
            terabyte
                8bits = 1byte
                storage = Byte per second (eg KBps)
                speed = bits per second (eg Kbps)
    - Delay
        bandwith -> how wide is the freeway
        delay -> how faster is data moving
    - Availability 
        availability -> how available is the network (roads ). 

    Network design
        Topologies
            - Bus network
                    Using thicknet and thinnet
            - Token ring
                    Token passing
            - Star topollogy
                    Switch in the middle
